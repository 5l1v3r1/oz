# Intro

Oz is a sandboxing system targeting everyday workstation applications.
It acts as a wrapper around application executables for completely transparent user operations. It achieves process containment through the use of [Linux Namespaces](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/namespaces.7.html), [Seccomp filters](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp.2.html), [Capabilities](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html), and X11 restriction using [Xpra](https://xpra.org/). It has built-in support with automatic configuration of bridge mode networking and also support working with contained network environment using the built in connection forwarding proxy.

# Warnings!

Please note that Oz is currently under major development and still at a very alpha stage. **As of this writing some features, like seccomp filters, are not yet available in the public master branch**. It is not intended for use in multi-users systems. Use it at your own risk!

# Installing

Due to the alpha nature of this project there currently is no package for easy installation.

## Prerequisites

Currently Oz only works and is only tested for Debian (>= jessie).
As of this writing it does **not** work in Ubuntu. While it has been minimally tested under Fedora,
there doesn't exist an RPM equivalent to `dpkg-divert` which allows to conveniantly wrap executables of existing program.
For seccomp filters you need at least kernel version 3.5.

It is highly recommend that you run it in conjunction with [grsecurity](https://grsecurity.net/).

### Dependencies

```
$ sudo apt-get install golang xpra bridge-utils libseccomp2 libcap2
```

You must also have the `veth` and `bridge` kernel module loaded to use *bridge network mode*.

### Grsec

If you are using grsecurity you will need to disable the following kernel options
permanently via the sysctl interface or by echoing values to files in
to files in `/proc/sys/kernel/grsecurity/`:

```
kernel.grsecurity.chroot_caps = 0
kernel.grsecurity.chroot_deny_chmod = 0
kernel.grsecurity.chroot_deny_mknod = 0
kernel.grsecurity.chroot_deny_mount = 0
```

See [Grsecurity/Appendix/Sysctl Options](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Grsecurity/Appendix/Sysctl_Options)
for information on setting grsecurity sysctl options.

### Network Manager

If you are using Network-Manager you need to make sure to exclude the bridge interface.
To do so a file must be created in `/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/oz.conf` containing:

```
[main]
plugins=keyfile

[keyfile]
unmanaged-devices=mac:6a:a8:2e:56:e8:9c;interface-name:oz0
```

If this file is missing `oz-daemon` will output a warning but it may fail to setup bridge networking.

### Bridge networking

Bridge networking is automatically configured by Oz, but you will need to setup
at minimum a few iptables masquerading rules and ebtables isolation rules as follows:

```
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o wlan0 -j MASQUERADE
sudo ebtables -P FORWARD DROP
sudo ebtables -F FORWARD
sudo ebtables -A FORWARD -i oz0 -j ACCEPT
sudo ebtables -A FORWARD -o oz0 -j ACCEPT
```

## Building

1. To setup a GOPATH for Oz, run the following commands (or you can use your
existing GOPATH):

```
$ export GOPATH=/opt/local/golang-oz
$ sudo mkdir -p $GOPATH
$ sudo chown user. $GOPATH
```

2. To build Oz with the required external Golang dependencies, run the following
commands:

```
$ go get github.com/tools/godep
$ go get -d github.com/subgraph/oz
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/subgraph/oz/
$ $GOPATH/bin/godep go install ./...
$ sudo cp $GOPATH/bin/oz* /usr/local/bin
$ sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/oz/cells.d
$ sudo cp $GOPATH/src/github.com/subgraph/oz/profiles/*.json /var/lib/oz/cells.d/
```

## Enabling a profile

Once installed you can enable profiles using the `oz-setup` command as such (using the profile for the 'evince' application):

```
$ sudo oz-setup install evince
```

This will install a symlink to the oz client executable in place of the original, and rename the original with the `.unsafe` suffix.

## Disabling a profile

If you want to disable a profile that you're not using or prior to uninstalling Oz, you can run the following command (once again
with 'evince' as the target application):


```
$ sudo oz-setup remove evince
```

If you have already uninstalled Oz you can remove the divertions manually using the `dpkg-divert` command.

## Viewing the status of a profile

You can view the status of a profile using the `status` sub-command:

```
$ sudo oz-setup status /usr/bin/lowriter
Package divert is installed for:     /usr/bin/libreoffice
Package divert is installed for:     /usr/bin/lowriter
Package divert is installed for:     /usr/bin/lobase
Package divert is installed for:     /usr/bin/localc
Package divert is installed for:     /usr/bin/loffice
<...output truncated for clarity>
```

# Usage

Firstly you must launch the daemon utility either with the init script or manually:

```
$ sudo oz-daemon
```

Once the daemon is started you can transparently launch any applications for which you have enabled the profile.
This means Oz sandboxing will be used whether you launch your browser from gnome-shell or from the command line.

Any files inside of your home passed as arguments to the command (either via double clicking or program arguments) are automatically added to the whitelist (if the profile supports `allow_files`).

The [OZ gnome-shell extension](https://github.com/subgraph/ozshell-gnome-extension) allows you to easily interface running sandboxes:
to add/remove files inside a sandbox, open a shell inside a sandbox, and terminate a sandbox.

If you wish to run an executable outside of the sandbox simply call it with the `unsafe` suffix:

```
$ /usr/bin/evince.unsafe
```

# Advanced Usage Information

## Oz client commands

The `oz` executable acts as a client for the daemon when called directly. It provides a number of commands to interact with sandboxes.

* `profiles`: lists available profiles
* `launch <name>`: launches a sandbox for the given profile name, pass the `--noexec` flag to prevent execution of the default program
* `list`: lists the running sandboxes
* `kill <id>`: kills the sandbox with the given numerical id
* `kill all`: kills all running sandboxes
* `shell <id>`: enters a shell in a given sandbox, mostly useful for debugging
* `logs [-f]`: prints out the logs, pass `-f` to follow the output

## Oz-daemon configurations

In nearly every case the default configurations should be used, but for debugging and development purposes some flags are configurable inside of the `/etc/oz/oz.conf` file. You can view the current configuration by running the following command:

```
$ oz-setup config show

Config file     : /etc/oz/oz.conf

environment_vars: [USER USERNAME LOGNAME LANG LANGUAGE _] # Default environment variables passed to sandboxes
```

## Profiles

Profiles files are simple JSON files located, by default, in `/var/lib/oz/cells.d`. They must include at minimum the path to the executable to be sandboxed using the `path` key. It may also define more executables to run under the same sandbox under the `paths` array; in which case a `name` key must also be specified. Some other base options are also available:

* `allow_files`: whether to allow binding of files passed as arguments inside the sandbox (does not affect files added manually)

### Xserver

This section defines the configuration of the Xserver (namely [xpra](https://www.xpra.org/)).
Possible options are:

* `enabled`: whether or not to use the Xserver
* `enable_tray`: whether or not to enable the Xpra tray diagnostic menu/tray (This requires the `[Top Icons](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/495/topicons/)` gnome-shell extension!)
* `tray_icon`: the path to an icon file to use for the to tray menu
* `window_icon`: the path to an icon file to use for windows
* `audio_mode`: one of [none|speaker|full] selects the audio passthrough mode (defaults: none)
* `disable_clipboard`: optionally disable clipboard sharing
* `enable_notifications`: enable passing of dbus notifications

### Network configs

The network can be configured in one of three different ways: host, bridge, and empty namespace, as defined in the `type` key.

* `empty`: the sandbox will live with an empty network namespace (ie: only `lo` interface)
* `bridge`: the sandbox will have its own network namespace and use *veth* to join a bridge named `oz0`
* `host`: the sandbox will share the network namespace with the host (usually not desirable)


#### Port Forwarding config

Oz allows you to forward ports on the loopback interface between the host and the sandbox.
This is useful so that you can expose some services (such as a socks proxy) to the sandbox without giving the sandbox any real network access.
You may define as many forwards, called `sockets` in the configuration, as you like.
Each socket configuration contains the following keys:

* `type`: One of `client`, or `server`, this defines whether to connect (*client*) or listen (*server*) on the host side
* `proto`: One of `tcp`, or `udp`, or `socket`
* `port`: The network port number to connect to
* `destination`: *Optional*, in client mode this is the address to connect to, in server mode this is the address to bind to. Defaults to *localhost*.


### Bind list

There exists two types of *bindlists*: a whitelist and a blacklist.
The whitelist allows you to bring files from the host into the sandbox; while the blacklist allows you to remove access to specific files or directories.

Both of these types support a few ways of resolving files:

* In the path by using the `${PATH}` prefix.
* In the home by using the `${HOME}` prefix.
* By replacing `${UID}` with the user numeric id.
* By replacing `${USER}` with the user login.
* By path globbing using the `*` wildcard.


The whitelist carries some extra caveats:

* If the original file does not exist and is inside the home, an empty directory will be created in its place if "can_create" is set.
* If the original file is a symlink it is resolved, but the target remains the same.
* An item can be marked as read only with the `readonly` boolean key.
* Files that are passed as arguments to the command are automatically added to the whitelist.


### Environment

One can specify which environment variables to pass by defining them in this list.
It is also possible to define static variables by also defining a `value` attribute in the list item.

### Example

You can find a list of existing profiles in the repository. Here is the porfile for running the `torbrowser-launcher`:

```
{
"path": "/usr/bin/torbrowser-launcher"
, "xserver": {
	"enabled": true
	, "enable_tray": true
	, "tray_icon":"/usr/share/pixmaps/torbrowser80.xpm"
}
, "networking":{
	"type":"empty"
	, "sockets": [
		{"type":"client", "proto":"tcp", "port":9050}
		, {"type":"client", "proto":"tcp", "port":9051}
	]
}
, "whitelist": [
	{"path":"${HOME}/.local/share/torbrowser"}
	, {"path":"${HOME}/.cache/torbrowser"}
	, {"path":"${HOME}/.config/torbrowser"}
	, {"path":"${HOME}/Downloads/TorBrowser"}
	, {"path":"/run/tor/control.authcookie"}
]
, "blacklist": [
]
, "environment": [
	{"name":"TOR_SKIP_LAUNCH"}
	, {"name":"TOR_SOCKS_HOST"}
	, {"name":"TOR_SOCKS_PORT"}
	, {"name":"TOR_CONTROL_PORT"}
	, {"name":"TOR_CONTROL_AUTHENTICATE"}
]
}
```
